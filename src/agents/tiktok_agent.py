'''
This AI agent will be able to watch TikTok and pull alpha from the comment section. 

I was inspired by the dumb money guys and the social arbitrage trading style that they approach. 

Essentially, social arbitrage is getting information prior to Wall Street. Wall Street is typically very slow at getting information. 

TikTok has all the information, and in the comment section of TikTok, there are some golden opportunities. 

The problem is, if you watch TikTok all day, you're gonna go brain dead. So I don't want to watch TikTok all day, but I do want the alpha. 

This agent will be able to see the trends and connect them with different Boomer Tokens (stocks).

"""
🚀 Moon Dev's TikTok Alpha Scraper
Navigates TikTok, captures video and comment screenshots for trading insights

1. Opens TikTok URL in browser
2. Detects share button position once at the start (to determine comment button position)
3. For each video:
   a. First checks if the video is LIVE by examining the URL
   b. If LIVE, skips processing and moves to next video with down arrow
   c. If not LIVE, continues with screenshot and analysis
4. For regular videos:
   a. Moves to comment button and clicks it
   b. Takes screenshot of the video and comments
   c. Analyzes screenshot with GPT-4o-mini to extract content and comments
   d. Saves analysis to CSV file for trading insights
   e. Uses double-click to ensure browser activation
   f. Presses down arrow to move to next video
5. Repeats steps 3-4 to collect data from regular videos only

The alpha is in the comments! 💰


TODO - 
- this works great, til it hits a live.... and then the double click takes us to more live.
the doublclick was to activate the screen to always scroll because it would break sometimes
but those sometimes were AFTER the lives... so the lives really kill this.... i can 
probably grab the link... 
✅ FIXED: Now detects live videos by checking URL and skips processing them entirely!
